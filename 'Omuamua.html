                Only 8 years ago, a mysterious object zipped through our own solar system. Swiftly passing by our protector, The Sun and disappearing just as it appeared. ‘Omuamua is an object of the unknown.
               
            </p>

            <p>
                During 2017, ‘Omuamua passed through our solar system at extremely high speeds. It was first spotted on the 19th of October 2017 and it was seemingly normal, being believed to be a comet by scientists. Yet without a visible coma or tail, this comet was reclassified as an asteroid later on.

            <p>
                Upon taking an interest in this object, scientists discovered its trajectory was quite unusual and realized that this object may have been from far away, an interstellar object. This was the first interstellar object detected by humans.

                Yet this was not the only strange thing about ‘omuamua. This object is shown to have a very unique shape. Although, we are not sure what this shape is exactly, it is believed to be cigar or disk shaped. This is because whilst using instruments, scientists noticed that the brightness of this object pulsated.

            <p>
                However strange it may seem, the mystery does not end there. The most unusual thing about this object from space is its motion. With physics as we know it, when objects such as comets move closer to the sun, they move at a faster speed. This happenss as their gravitational potential energy decreases and their kinetic energy increases as a result of the strong gravitational pull from the Sun. Contrastingly, ‘Omuamua did not do this. Since this object was only spotted when it had already approached the sun, we were unable to see it moving towards the sun. However, when it was leaving, despite the laws of physics known to us, ‘Omuamua accelerated. This meant that something must have been pushing ‘Omuamua forward instead of allowing it to slow down. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the current research don’t by scientists, we still do not know exactly why this happened, However there were a few theories. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Scientists immediately thought that perhaps solar winds would have pushed ‘Omuamua forward, explaining its strange motion. However, this was immediately disproved since solar winds would be unable to affect the speed of the comet by such an extent.
